require not ended after highest bid is value after bid's blinded bid is 0 after length is bids list at the money sender's length after beneficiary is beneficiary after  and 

Then, bidding end is now added to bidding time before reveal end is bidding end added to reveal time and bids list at the money sender's push bid blinded bid the money sent by the sender before require values's length is equal to length and require fake's length is equal to length and require secret's length is equal to length

Then, refund is default value before for i is 0, i is less than length, add one to i and loop bid is bids list at the money sender list at i and value and fake and secret is values list at i fake list at i secret list at i and if bid's blinded bid is not equal to keccak256 value fake secret then endif and refund gains bid's deposit and if not fake and bid's deposit is greater than or equal to value then if place bid the money sender value then refund loses value and endif and endif

Then, endloop and the money sender's transfer refund if value is less than or equal to highest bid then false endif and if highest bidder is not equal to 0 then pending returns list at highest bidder gains highest bid before endif

Then, highest bidder is bidder

Then, true amount is pending returns list at the money sender before if amount is greater than 0 then pending returns list at the money sender is 0 and the money sender's transfer amount and endif before auction ended highest bidder highest bid

Then, ended is true before beneficiary's transfer highest bid
